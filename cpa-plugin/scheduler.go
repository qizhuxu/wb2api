// This file implements CPA's Scheduler capability, which lets the plugin decide
// which credential a request uses.
//
// Why this matters
//
// CPA normally picks the auth itself. The Scheduler capability hands the plugin
// the candidate list and lets it return one, which is what makes the account
// selection strategy configurable from the panel.
//
// Three strategies are offered:
//
//	by_credits  largest remaining quota first  — the source app's behaviour
//	              (A0/s.java:585 t() keeps the candidate with the greatest
//	               credits after filtering)
//	round_robin strictly rotating position      — predictable, spreads load
//	random      uniformly at random             — avoids hotspots entirely
//
// All three honour the same availability filter, mirroring A0/s.java:596:
//
//	not disabled, not in a cooldown window, status not failed
//
// and they never pick a credential the request has already tried.

// schedulerStrategy names the supported selection modes.
